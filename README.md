# ModernRAM

ModernRAM is a tool for students to help them learn how to think like a computer. It can be used at any level of education. It only requires basic knowledge of computer operations and few english words. 

## Instalation
You can download this program (as compressed zip or as MSIX installer.) for free from release tab in GitHub or you can also purchase it from Microsoft Store (only for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10)

## Building from source 
To build ModernRAM from source you must have Visual Studio with .Net Core 3.1 installed. If you want to build RAMEditorSetup you must have UWP component installed, because it's an MSIX installer.

## Special thanks
I would like to say thank you to all who helped me with testing and supported me in creating this project.
